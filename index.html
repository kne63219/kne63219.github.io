	<p>This webpage is all about me! (yay) I am a psychology major and HDFS minor with an emphasis on Human Sexuality. I hope to become a therapist after receiving my doctorate from a specialized institute in San Diego, after getting my undergrad and masters here at UGA. As a therapist I would be qualified to work with couples, singles, and people of all age ranges doing a variety of things. This could include: working on communication, sexual assault recovery, struggles with identity and sexual orientation and much, much more! I picked this career because I wanted something new and interesting to come through my door everyday. I think that my work will help benefit other people and give them more confidence along with a positive mind and body image. I am a firm believer in doing everything I can in order to not live the same day over and over again. </p>
	<p> I used to play basketball for UGA but I was diagnosed with a heart condition and my career was ended prematurely for my own personal health. More about my time with the Lady Dogs and my condition is linked below.</p>

<p> Since I have been diagnosed with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy I have been a spokesperson for The American Heart Association and GoRed For Women. I am now actively invloved in motivating and inspiring others to also get involved in the movement for finding a cure for heart disease. I am also very activelty involved in the athletic community to improve the emotional transition for medically disqualified athletes. The link to my story for The American Heart Association video will be linked below to help shed more light on the severity of heart disease in America.

<p> One important thing about em is that I love to travel. I like all kind of weather (sun or snow). I'm from Columbus Ohio so I get plenty of each every year. I want to be amazed by the beauty of the Earth and go on new adventures beyond the bubble that is the US. The farthest I've been is to Hawaii but I have a list of places that I really want to see! </p>
<ol>
  <li>Scotland</li>
  <li>Bora Bora</li>
  <li>Italy</li>
  <li>Greece</li>
  <li>Australia</li>
</ol>
<p> The list is still growing!</p>
